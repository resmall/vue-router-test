# Laravel Elixir + vue.js + vue-router

Small and simple, this app is a way to get in contact with Laravel 
Elixir and vue.
There's no purpose, its's just to get to know the functionalities 
provided and what can be achieved with it.

It is based on Matt Stauffer's blog post [here](https://mattstauffer.co/blog/getting-started-using-vues-vue-router-for-single-page-apps).
